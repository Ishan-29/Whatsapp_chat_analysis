# Whatsapp_chat_analysis

Whatsapp has quickly become the worldâ€™s most popular text and voice messaging application. Specializing in cross-platform messaging with over 2 billion monthly active users, this makes it the most popular mobile messenger app worldwide. So I have done data analysis on a whatsapp group chat of peoples to find out interesting insights about who is most active, who are ghosts, the most used emoji, the most actives times of the day, the most active time of the month etc.
